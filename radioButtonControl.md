<!-- Radio Button Control in ASP.NET -->

<!-- The radio button control is used when you want the user to select only one option from the available choices. For example, the gender of a person. So, if the user has first selected male and if they try to select female the initial male selection they made will automatically be de-selected. Another example, would be when you want the user to select their favourite colour. -->

<!-- In short, if you want to provide the user with mutually exclusive options then choose a Radio Button control. -->

<!-- Important Properties of the Radio Button Control -->

<!-- 1. Checked -->
<!-- This is a boolean property, that is used to check if the button is checked or not. -->

<!-- 2. Text -->
<!-- This is a string property used to get or set the text associated with the radio button control. -->

<!-- 3. TextAlign -->
<!-- This property can either be right or left. It aligns on which side of the radio button the text will appear.  -->

<!-- 4. AutoPostBack -->
<!-- Set this property to true, if you want the webform to be posted immediately when the checked status of the radio button changes. -->
