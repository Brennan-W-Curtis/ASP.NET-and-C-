<!-- RadioButtonList Controls in ASP.NET -->

<!-- In ASP.NET there are several list controls, such as:  -->
<!-- 1. DropDownList -->
<!-- 2. CheckBoxList -->
<!-- 3. BulletedList -->
<!-- 4. ListBox -->
<!-- 5. RadioButtonList -->

<!-- Just like every other list control -->
<!-- 1. The RadioButtonList is also a collection of ListItem objects. -->
<!-- 2. Items can be added to the RadioButtonList in the HTML or in the code behind file. -->
<!-- 3. The RadioButtonList like any other list control supports data binding. -->

<!-- CheckBoxList is generally used, when you want to present the user with multiple choices, from which you want them to select one or more options. -->

<!-- Where as, if you want the user to select a single option, then a RadioButtonList control can be used. The RadioButtonList is commonly used to present mutually exclusive choices. -->
