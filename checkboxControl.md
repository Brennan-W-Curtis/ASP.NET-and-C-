<!-- CheckBox Control in ASP.NET -->

<!-- The CheckBox Control is used, when you want the user to select more than one option from the available choices. For example, the education of a person. A person can have a graduate degree, post graduate degree, and a doctrate. In this case the user selects all the 3 checkboxes. Where as a person, may just have a graduate degree, which case they only select, the graduate checkbox. -->

<!-- Another example, would be when you want the user to select days of availablility. -->
