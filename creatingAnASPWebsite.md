<!-- Web Applications -->

<!-- What is a Web Application -->
<!-- A web application is an application that is accessed by users using a web browser. -->

<!-- What are the advantages of Web applications? -->
<!-- 1. Web Applications just need to be installed on on the web server, where as desktop applications need to be installed on every computer, where you want to access them. -->
<!-- 2. Maintenance, support, and patches are easier to provide. -->
<!-- 3. Only a browser is required on the client machine to access a web application. -->
<!-- 4. Accessible from anywhere, provided there is an internet connection. -->
<!-- 5. It's Cross Platform.-->
<!-- 6. Web applications work on client/server architecture. -->
<!-- 7. On the client all you need is a browser, that can understand HTML. -->
<!-- 8. On the server side, the Web application runs under Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS). -->

<!-- Different Windows in Visual Studio -->

<!-- Web Forms -->

<!-- Web Forms: WebForms has the extension of .aspx. -->

<!-- A web form also has a code behind and designer files. Code behind files have the extension of .aspx.cs or .aspx.vb. -->

<!-- Designer files contain the extension of .aspx.designer.cs or .aspx.designer.vb. -->

<!-- Code behind gfiles contain the code that a user writes, whereas the designer file contains the auto generated code. You shouldn't change the code in the designer file, because that code might later be modified by Visual Studio and your changes could be overwritten. -->

<!-- A Web form is associated within it's code file using the @Page directive. -->
<!-- Ex. <%@ Page Title="Home Page" Language="C#" MasterPageFile="~/Site.master" AutoEventWireup="true" CodeBehind="Default.aspx.cs" Inherits="WebApplication._Default" %> -->

<!-- A webform's HTML can be edited either in SOURCE or DESIGN mode. You can also choose SPLIT mode, which shows both the design and the source at the same time.-->
